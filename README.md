Notebooks for exploring data associated with the Open Problems competition on Kaggle, presented at NeurIPS 2022

## Run in Saturn Cloud

Saturn Cloud is a data science platform for scalable Python, R, and Julia for teams and individuals. Without having to switch any tools, Saturn provides a flexible environment where computational biologists and data scientists can launch high-powered notebooks (Jupyter, RStudio, VS Code, and more) in the cloud, quickly use Dask clusters, GPUs, deploy cloud resources to expand their data science capabilities, collaborate throughout an entire project lifecycle, and more.

Saturn Cloud supports use cases for single-cell analysis, high content screening, collaboration across teams, big data, and much more. Popular tools such as Scanpy and Seurat are readily available, as well as support for hosting custom libraries.

If you'd like to participate in the NeurIPS 2022 competition with free compute resources, click on the link below. If you message Saturn Cloud support, and say  "I'm competeing in NeurIPS 2022, I'd like more compute" you will be upgraded to 100 hours per month.
