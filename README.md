# Kaggle notebooks for Saturn Cloud 

This repository hosts notebooks for the [Open Problems - Multimodal Single-Cell Integration competition on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/open-problems-multimodal/), presented at NeurIPS 2022. We created this repository so you can easily run notebooks for free on Saturn Cloud on an instance with 128 GB RAM, 32 core CPU, and 16GB GPU memory.

### Get started

If you message Saturn Cloud support, and say  "I'm competing in NeurIPS 2022, I'd like more compute" you will be upgraded to 100 hours per month.

If you don't need GPUs, [click this to run the CPU based configuration](https://app.community.saturnenterprise.io/dash/resources?recipeUrl=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openproblems-bio/neurips_2022_notebooks/main/.saturn/saturn-cpu.json).

### Free Compute Resources with Saturn Cloud

[Saturn Cloud](https://saturncloud.io) is a data science platform for scalable Python, R, and Julia for teams and individuals. Without having to switch any tools, Saturn provides a flexible environment where computational biologists and data scientists can launch high-powered notebooks (Jupyter, RStudio, VS Code, and more) in the cloud, quickly use Dask clusters, GPUs, deploy cloud resources to expand their data science capabilities, collaborate throughout an entire project lifecycle, and more.

Saturn Cloud supports use cases for single-cell analysis, high content screening, collaboration across teams, big data, and much more. Popular tools such as Scanpy and Seurat are readily available, as well as support for hosting custom libraries.
